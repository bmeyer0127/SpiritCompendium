    "spiritName": "Uncle Nearest 1884",
    "typeOfSpirit": "Tennessee Whiskey",
    "distillery": "Nearest Green",
    "proof": "93",
    "nose": "Honey and warm brown sugar, cedar, orange peel and tobacco flower. Spices of ground ginger and white pepper.",
    "palate": "Caramel balanced with spicy wood tannins. Notes of baking chocolate, cigar lead, cougar and cinnamon.",
    "finish": "Long and smooth. The cinnamon lingers with dark chocolate, oak tannins and maple syrup.",
    "cocktailName": "Boulevardier",
    "cocktail": [
      ".75oz sweet vermouth",
      ".75oz Campari",
      "1.5oz Uncle Nearest Rye",
      "Stirred",
      "Rocks glass with big rock",
      "Orange peel"
    ],
    "cocktailDescription": "The boulevardier tends to be one of my favorite whiskey cocktails and I could not describe how amazing it works with Uncle Nearest Rye. The flagship spicy bite from a rye gets quelled from the vermouth and rolls so well into the smooth, medicinal bitterness of the campari. The vanilla finish wraps it up nice and tidy, readying you for a second sip before you even realize you’ve swallowed. Play around with some bitters when making this. Add some personal flair.",
    "story": "Uncle Nearest tends to be one of our most talked about and touched bottles in our reservoir. The consensus seems to point out that it is an absolute favorite amongst our bartenders. The tall-standing quality is not the only reason though. The brand pays homage to the rich history of whiskey and while keeping the shadowed history of early America completely in sight. The brand itself is named after Nathan “Nearest” Green. Green was born into slavery in Maryland but was brought to Lincoln County, Tennessee in the 1850s. He was owned by a trading firm called Landis and Green who hired him out to a country preacher and distiller named Dan Call. This is believed to be the time Green learned how to distill and worked on his iterations of the Lincoln County Process, the process of running whiskey through a charcoal filter. Here is where Nathan Green and Jack Daniel met. Daniel was an 8 year old hired onto Call’s farm as a chore and errand boy. After a while, he began to show interest in the smoke billowing out of a stack on the property, the distillery. Call introduced Green by saying “This is Uncle Nearest. He’s the best whiskey maker I know of.” From there he began to teach Jack the process. After the end of the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation was signed. Nathan Green continued working on the Call farm as a “free man.” Eventually Jack Daniel would move to start his own distillery, but Green never went to work there. Many of Green’s children and grand-children did, though. Despite there being virtually no mention of Nathan Green in official Jack Daniels literature, he was undoubtedly pivotal in Daniel’s distilling career. In 2019 Victoria Eady Butler (a direct descendant of Nathan Green) was announced as Uncle Nearest’s master blender. Thus becoming the first known African-American female master whiskey blender."
