    "story": "Uncle Nearest tends to be one of our most talked about and touched bottles in our reservoir. The consensus seems to point out that it is an absolute favorite amongst our bartenders. The tall-standing quality is not the only reason though. The brand pays homage to the rich history of whiskey and while keeping the shadowed history of early America completely in sight. The brand itself is named after Nathan “Nearest” Green. Green was born into slavery in Maryland but was brought to Lincoln County, Tennessee in the 1850s. He was owned by a trading firm called Landis and Green who hired him out to a country preacher and distiller named Dan Call. This is believed to be the time Green learned how to distill and worked on his iterations of the Lincoln County Process, the process of running whiskey through a charcoal filter. Here is where Nathan Green and Jack Daniel met. Daniel was an 8 year old hired onto Call’s farm as a chore and errand boy. After a while, he began to show interest in the smoke billowing out of a stack on the property, the distillery. Call introduced Green by saying “This is Uncle Nearest. He’s the best whiskey maker I know of.” From there he began to teach Jack the process. After the end of the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation was signed. Nathan Green continued working on the Call farm as a “free man.” Eventually Jack Daniel would move to start his own distillery, but Green never went to work there. Many of Green’s children and grand-children did, though. Despite there being virtually no mention of Nathan Green in official Jack Daniels literature, he was undoubtedly pivotal in Daniel’s distilling career. In 2019 Victoria Eady Butler (a direct descendant of Nathan Green) was announced as Uncle Nearest’s master blender. Thus becoming the first known African-American female master whiskey blender."

    "cocktailDescription": "1856 is a spirit that you do not want to drown out in a fit of sweetners. I would never talk bad about a classic Manhattan, but the splitting of the sweet vermouth and addition of the dry helps give this whiskey a bit more to stand on. Get wild with the bitters, maybe even throw in a bit of absinthe in for the wicked. This should be a delicate cocktail for the curious.",

    "cocktailDescription": "The boulevardier tends to be one of my favorite whiskey cocktails and I could not describe how amazing it works with Uncle Nearest Rye. The flagship spicy bite from a rye gets quelled from the vermouth and rolls so well into the smooth, medicinal bitterness of the campari. The vanilla finish wraps it up nice and tidy, readying you for a second sip before you even realize you’ve swallowed. Play around with some bitters when making this. Add some personal flair.",

    "story": "Suyo No. 1 is a Peruvian pisco made 100% from Quebranta grapes. This grape is a descendant of the very grape that was initially used for pisco distillation. The original was a dark, black grape brought by the Spanish. However, after generations of adapting to the rough, rocky terrain of Peru, the flavor changed dramatically and became known as the Quebranta grape. Quebranta, coming from quebrar, the Spanish term for ‘broken’ or ‘tamed.’ Quebranta piscos are considered ‘non-aromatic’ but that is more of an attempt at classification rather than a true descriptor. Of course they still have a distinct aroma, simply less so than other counterparts, like the Italia variety. The grapes that make this pisco are picked, and then allowed to ferment for 2-3 weeks and are then single distilled in a copper still. Suyo pisco started off as a project shared between two Peruvian-American partners, Alex Hildebrandt and Ian Legget. The story goes that they were on the search for new piscos that could become their new favorites, but were disappointed at the extreme scarcity of choices in the American market. A few steps later, Suyo was born and prides itself in sourcing from family-owned vineyards. Pisco in and of itself is an extremely interesting subject. It is a spirit that can be made in Peru or Chile and both tend to serve in their own rite. Peruvian piscos must fit into a tinier box than Chilean pisco. For example, pisco from Peru can be made from one of only 8 different varieties of grapes, whereas piscos in Chile have 13 different choices. Chile also allows barrel age, where Peru does not and instead requires a rest in a non-reactive cask, think glass instead of the more common wooden. Another major distinction is that Peru is required to only export single distilled piscos, whereas in Chile, you can distill it to the point where it is basically a vodka if you’d like to. It is far from anyone to say which country produces the best or most widely enjoyed piscos as both produce a product that hits their intended mark."
