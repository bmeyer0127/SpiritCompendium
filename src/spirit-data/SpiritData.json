    "story": "Uncle Nearest tends to be one of our most talked about and touched bottles in our reservoir. The consensus seems to point out that it is an absolute favorite amongst our bartenders. The tall-standing quality is not the only reason though. The brand pays homage to the rich history of whiskey and while keeping the shadowed history of early America completely in sight. The brand itself is named after Nathan “Nearest” Green. Green was born into slavery in Maryland but was brought to Lincoln County, Tennessee in the 1850s. He was owned by a trading firm called Landis and Green who hired him out to a country preacher and distiller named Dan Call. This is believed to be the time Green learned how to distill and worked on his iterations of the Lincoln County Process, the process of running whiskey through a charcoal filter. Here is where Nathan Green and Jack Daniel met. Daniel was an 8 year old hired onto Call’s farm as a chore and errand boy. After a while, he began to show interest in the smoke billowing out of a stack on the property, the distillery. Call introduced Green by saying “This is Uncle Nearest. He’s the best whiskey maker I know of.” From there he began to teach Jack the process. After the end of the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation was signed. Nathan Green continued working on the Call farm as a “free man.” Eventually Jack Daniel would move to start his own distillery, but Green never went to work there. Many of Green’s children and grand-children did, though. Despite there being virtually no mention of Nathan Green in official Jack Daniels literature, he was undoubtedly pivotal in Daniel’s distilling career. In 2019 Victoria Eady Butler (a direct descendant of Nathan Green) was announced as Uncle Nearest’s master blender. Thus becoming the first known African-American female master whiskey blender."
